## About
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning. Our objective is to develop a machine learning model that can assist Sunbase in understanding and predicting when a customer is likely to churn. Customer churn is a critical metric for business success, and we aim to leverage historical customer data to build an effective predictive model.

## Data
We have access to a comprehensive dataset containing historical customer information. This dataset includes various customer attributes, interactions, and a binary indicator of whether a customer churned or not. This rich dataset serves as the foundation for our machine learning model.

## Tasks
Our project follows a structured pipeline, covering the following tasks:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - We begin by loading the provided dataset and conducting an initial data exploration.
   - Handling missing data and identifying and addressing outliers are vital steps in this phase.
   - We prepare the data for machine learning by encoding categorical variables and splitting it into training and testing sets.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - In this phase, we harness our creativity and domain knowledge to generate relevant features from the dataset.
   - These engineered features aim to improve the model's prediction accuracy.
   - We apply feature scaling or normalization when necessary to ensure the model's stability.

3. **Model Building:**
   - We carefully select machine learning algorithms tailored to this problem, considering options like logistic regression, random forests, or neural networks.
   - The selected model is trained and validated using the training dataset.
   - To evaluate the model's performance, we use appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Model Optimization:**
   - Fine-tuning the model parameters is crucial for enhancing predictive performance.
   - We explore techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best results.

5. **Model Deployment:**
   - Once we are satisfied with the model's performance, we deploy it in a production-like environment.
   - This deployment enables the model to handle new customer data as input and provide churn predictions in real-time.

## Deliverables
Our project delivers the following key items:

1. **Jupyter Notebook or Python Script:**
   - This contains our code, showcasing each step of the machine learning pipeline.

2. **Project Report:**
   - We provide a detailed report summarizing our approach, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection decisions.
   
3. **Model Performance Metrics and Visualizations:**
   - Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are presented alongside visualizations to provide a comprehensive overview of the model's performance.
